# Hide Player Frame

Automatically hides your player frame when you're not in combat and don't have a target. Simple as that.

I made this because I wanted a cleaner UI without constantly seeing my own health bar. The frame shows up when you actually need it - in combat or when you're targeting something.

## Usage

Type `/hpf` to toggle auto-hide on or off. Your setting is saved between sessions.

When enabled:

- Player frame shows in combat
- Player frame shows when you have a target
- Player frame hides otherwise

When disabled, your UI works like normal.

## Installation

Install through Wago App or download and extract to your AddOns folder, then `/reload`.
